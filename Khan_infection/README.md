# Khan_Academy_Infection

This project is part of the Khan Academy Project Interview Infection Question. The specs for this project can be found here: https://docs.google.com/a/khanacademy.org/document/d/1NiKv-MjULOFyyc8f5w8R_EqvuPJ10wJVJgZhtTK9VKc/edit#heading=h.24vvz52659j3. 

I submitted my project in a iPython Notebook (.ipynb) format, as well as in corresponding .html and .py formats.  For best viewing, you can see the entirety of my project via the iPython Notebook, including the output of the programmed cells and  inline visualizations. There is no new information in the other files. 

To run the code on the iPython Notebook (the output from my running the code is already shown), you must first install Jupyter Notebook. Please refer to the following link for installation instructions: http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html. Otherwise, you can simply open and run the .py file since it includes all the code, with the tests and the code to call them placed right after each function. 

With more time, I would love to improve my version of limited_infection() as well as my visualization. More information about my code, algorithms, and future thoughts can be found in my iPython Notebook.
